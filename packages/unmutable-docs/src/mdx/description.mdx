An immutable, functional data collection library for plain old Javascript.

It combines my favourite parts of [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide) and [ramdajs](https://ramdajs.com/) together.

Unmutable follows [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)'s API almost exactly, and but exports each method individually as a [point-free function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming), in the same way as [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide) does. These functions are all immutable, and can be composed together easily.

Unmutable also works seamlessly on plain Javascript objects and arrays, Immutable.js Maps, Lists and Records.
