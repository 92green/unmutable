# unmutable

*Immutable.js functions for collections that may or may not be Immutable.*

Immutable.js is good because:
- Wonderful API

Immutable.js is bad for libraries because:
- It's big, and you can't cherry pick
- It's not transparent when dealing with Immutable.js and non-Immutable.js objects

## Installation

```
yarn add unmutable
```

## Example

```
go away
```
